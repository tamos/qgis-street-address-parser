# qgis-street-address-parser


A QGIS plugin to parse street addresses into their component parts using a deep learning model from deepparse.org. Work in progress.

Source code for the API is also [available.](https://github.com/tamos/qgis-street-address-parser-api)

As of writing (October 2021) QGIS doesn't yet have a neat way to use external python libraries. To use this plugin, you will need to clone the API repository linked above and follow the steps in the README to get set up.
